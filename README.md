This is Giridhar Maji's personal [homepage](https://giridhar.github.io/).

## A short introduction
I am a educationalist, an Engineer and a researcher. My research focuses on Complex Network Analysis, Social Influencer Identification, Information security and Resource scheduling in Cloud environments . I mainly use data mining, graph based network modelling and statistical tools to carry out my research works.

PROFILE:
* Highly self-motivated researcher with demonstrated research expertise modeling complex networks and epidemic spreading processes. 
* Strong interpersonal skills with a good sense of teamwork.
* Programming Skills: Matlab/R, Java, and Python in both Linux and Windows environments.
* Rich experience in tools like GEPHI, ORIGIN Plots, and QGIS.
